A cloud based environment presents several new risks, not forgetting the fact it also mitigates some others. Especially with public clouds the customer has only limited capabilities to affect business related decisions, which might pose a great risk. There are examples where actions like this have realized.

This was presumed to increase the risk of a governmental actor to get access to the keys (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-apple-icloud-insight/apple-moves-to-store-icloud-keys-in-china-raising-human-rights-fears-idUSKCN1G8060, accessed 22.9.2018). This article is a good reminder that there might be providers who would grant access to data under a pressure or legislative force for powerful actors like governments.
