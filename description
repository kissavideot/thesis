Abstract

Increasing number of services are running on top of a outsourced cloud environments, this has changed the security landscape. These changes have led to a situation where extra care has to be applied in order to avoid various unwanted events from taking place due to new threat factors native to both cloud and outsourcing. This thesis is an attempt at highlighting these relatively new threat factors in addition to providing a straight forward checklist that can be used as a self-assessment tool to identify, acknowledge and hopefully also remedy some of these threats.

While the goal of the thesis, the self-assessment spreadsheet is not meant as a replacement for other audit criterioin but as an additional set of questions to ask, written especially from the perspective of running services on top of outsourced cloud environment. Some questions are directed towards the service provider and to be asked by the potential customer to gauge the readyness of the service provider. Customers can also measure their own understanding of the security aspects related to cloud deployment based on these questions.

Research problem of this thesis is the challenge of the identifying the new threats natively related to cloud. The research method used was a literature review; trying to find literature covering the topic either directly or by means of applying what has been written for general security and continuity while adopting it to the context of a cloud. The later was found to be surprisingly common as we found that there simply was not a large quantities of documentation available related to auditing cloud deployments.

Primary result of this thesis is that MONTAKO KOHTAA MEILLE TULI SIIHEN LAPPUUN? were identified as topics for questions to ask before, during and after a cloud deployment. It is deemed obvious that there are plenty of other attack vectors and threats that were not properly documentedin this thesis, including matters such as change management and time procols and their importance in overall security and availability. These, and other evolving threats are to be added later on if the assignor of the thesis sees this approach suitable for their purposes.
