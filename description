Abstract

Increasing number of services running on top of outsourced cloud environments has led to changes in the security landscape. These changes have led to a situation where extra care has to be applied in order to ensure that the services continue to run smoothly and securely in the world where new threaths are emerging. This thesis aims at finding the key points every organization should take into account when planning to run or already running their services in cloud. The result - a self-assessment tool - aims at being a easily manageable checklist which can be used to identify, acknowledge and also to limit the dangers posed by the threaths tied especially to the cloud environments.

## This thesis is an attempt at highlighting these relatively new threat factors in addition to providing a straightforward checklist that can be used as a self-assessment tool to identify, acknowledge and hopefully also remedy some of these threats.
## avoid various unwanted events from taking place due to new threat factors native to both cloud and outsourcing. 



While the goal of the thesis, the self-assessment spreadsheet, is not meant as a replacement for other audit criterion,  instead its purpose is to define the set of most important questions to ask, written especially from the perspective of running services on top of outsourced cloud environments. Some questions are directed also towards the service provider and should be asked by the potential customer to gauge the readyness of the service provider. Customers can also measure their own understanding of the security aspects related to cloud deployments based on these questions.

Research problem of this thesis is the challenge of identification of the new threaths natively related to cloud. The research method used was a literature review; trying to find literature covering the topic either directly or by means of applying what has been written for general security and continuity while adopting it to the context of a cloud. The latter was found to be surprisingly common as we found that there simply was not large quantities of documentation available related to auditing cloud deployments.

Primary result of this thesis is that MONTAKO KOHTAA MEILLE TULI SIIHEN LAPPUUN? were identified as topics for questions to ask before, during and after a cloud deployment. It is obvious that anyone could add dozens more questions, especially for special needs of different types of businesses and data, but these can be tackled in more detail using specific audit criterion or following the available regulation. Also, especially for small businesses or services these can be too complex, expensive and unnecessary to apply if they are not really needed.


## It is deemed obvious that there are plenty of other attack vectors and threats that were not properly documented in this thesis, including matters such as change management and time procols and their importance in overall security and availability. These, and other evolving threats are to be added later on if the assignor of the thesis sees this approach suitable for their purposes.
