Abstract

Increasing number of services running on top of outsourced cloud environments has led to changes in the security landscape. These changes have led to a situation where extra care has to be applied in order to ensure that the services continue to run smoothly and securely in the world where new threaths are emerging. This thesis aims at finding the key points every organization should take into account during the planning, production and decommissioning phases when running services in cloud. The result - a self-assessment tool - aims at being an easily manageable checklist which can be used to identify, acknowledge and also to limit the dangers posed by the threaths tied especially to the cloud environments.

While the goal of the thesis, the self-assessment spreadsheet, is not meant as a replacement for other audit criterion; its purpose is to define the set of most important questions to ask, written especially from the perspective of running services on top of outsourced cloud environments. Some questions are directed also towards the service provider and should be asked by the potential customer to gauge the readyness of the service provider. Customers can also measure their own understanding of the security aspects related to cloud deployments based on these questions.

Research problem of this thesis is the challenge of identifying the threaths closely related to the cloud. The research method used is a literature review; trying to find literature covering the topic either directly or by means of applying what has been written for general security and continuity while adapting it to the context of the cloud. The latter method was required as the amount of literature directly related to auditing cloud deployments was found scarce.

Primary result of this thesis is that MONTAKO KOHTAA MEILLE TULI SIIHEN LAPPUUN? were identified as topics for questions to ask before, during and after a cloud deployment. It is obvious that anyone could add dozens more questions, especially for special needs of different types of businesses and data, but these can be tackled in more detail using specific audit criterion or following the relevant regulation.
