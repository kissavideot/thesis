Even though the cloud as technology has been existing for several years, there are still surprisingly little of decent material available, that became a reality when trying to gather decent material.

Nevertheless, during the making of this thesis, there was an ongoing work with a cloud criteria going on in Traficom, which we provided some feedback to.
