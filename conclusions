Even though the cloud as a technology has been existing for several years, there are still surprisingly little material available in terms of audit criterion, this became a reality when authors started to gather material for this thesis. Especially the security in cloud seems to be investigated quite little, even though there is definitely need for this. However, as there was rather limited material to use for this cloud security survey, especially given the confidential nature of the questionnaire, the shortcomings were seen more like a challenge and something that we took as a sign of need for the thesis. 

The shortage of material wasn't the only challenge as the material we found was often written from different standpoint. As this thesis was made by two technically oriented professionals, the lack of real-life experience of many writers was quite disturbing. Nonetheless, from the material a few real treasures were found, such as Helpert's book of cloud security and privacy, also there are some academic material that discusses cloud in particularly from descriptive stand point, such as the master's thesis of Saara Suikkanen that provides clear descriptions and definitions for basic concepts of the cloud. While not maybe 100% cloud related the IETF RFCs from the standards track continue to be invaluable source of reference information, especially when evaluating if a solution proposed by service provider is compliant with the standards. Also, as our focus was strongly from the audit perspective, many of the sources seemed quite shallow and even naive.

Although the aging criteria in Katakri 2015 was a big motivator on this, it was clear that it wouldn't fully benefit the target audience as such, as many of the criterion in it are too complex, controversial or just simply too tight for trivial business use-cases. Nevertheless, during the writing process of this thesis, there was an ongoing debate with a cloud criteria going on in Traficom, which we provided some feedback to.

Another motivator was the Cloud Alliance's form. We went through it with much detail, although this work didn't find its way to this thesis. Nevertheless, many of the core topics can be found in here. The biggest challenge with the Cloud Alliance's material is the mere size of it: dozens and dozens of criterion makes it purely exhausting. One of the key aspects to this work was to avoid coming up with too technical audit criterion, this was deemed as especially important in order to avoid non-technical parties being "scared" with audit text. Authors tried to compensate on this with more detailed introduction to cryptography and the availability aspects within networking.

In the end, we are quite happy with some of the criterion, but there are some flaws also. We managed to keep the criteria in a manageable amount, yet in our material some obvious details were neglected, similar to network time protocol or precision time protocols, as it is important particularly in logs and especially to administration connections to have the absolutely correct timestamps, which is one of the top three things to secure. Although we would have wanted to add several details here and there, we left them out because of the fact that these were not mentioned in the source material, yet a skilled technician can understand that at least these two examples are a part of logging and encryption/defense in depth.

- Cloud security criteria by Traficom - analysis against the newest version
- Perfect security in cloud can never be achieved as it is a mixture of technical and contractual world (+ trust etc.). But, new technologies must be adapted and as cloud is more than technical, you have to think outside of just information technology (it is also a business model).
