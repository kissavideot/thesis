Even though the cloud as technology has been existing for several years, there are still surprisingly little of decent material available, this became a reality when starting to gather decent material. Especially the security in cloud seems to be investigated quite little, even though there is definitely need for this. Nevertheless, as there was little material to use for this cloud security survey that was done here, the shortage was seen more like a challenge and something that we deemed was a good addition.

The shortage of material wasn't the only challence, the material we found was often of quite poor quality. As this thesis was made by two technically oriented professionals, the lack of real-life experience of many writers was quite disturbing. Nevertheless, from the material a few real treasures were found, like the Helpert's book of cloud security. Also, as our focus was strongly from the audit perspective, many of the sources seemed quite shallow and even naive.

Although the criteria in Katakri 2015 was a big motivator on this, it was clear that it wouldn't fully benefit the target audience as such, as many of the criterion in it are too complex, controversial or just simply too tight for use. Nevertheless, during the making of this thesis, there was an ongoing work with a cloud criteria going on in Traficom, which we provided some feedback to.

Another motivator was the Cloud Alliance's form. We went through it with much detail, although this work didn't find its way to this thesis. Nevertheless, many of the core topics can be found in here. The biggest challenge with the Cloud Alliance's material is the mere size of it: dozens and dozens of criterion makes it purely exhausting. We didn't want that as if something is too complex, who has the time and willingness to do it well or worse, to do it at all.

In the end, we are quite happy with some of the criterion, but there are some flaws also. We managed to keep the criteria in a manageable amount, yet in our material some obvious details were neglected, like NTP (yes, it is important especially in logs!). Although we would have wanted to add several details here and there, we left them out because of the fact that these weren't mentioned in the source material.
